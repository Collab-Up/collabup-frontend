cd CollabUp
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com

VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_emailjs_template_id

# Recommendation API
VITE_RECOMMENDATION_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

#### Firebase Configuration
1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Download your `serviceAccountKey.json` and place it in the root directory
5. Update the Firebase configuration in `src/firebase/firebaseConfig.ts`

#### EmailJS Setup
1. Create an account at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create email templates for:
   - Mentorship booking confirmation
   - Project collaboration requests
   - Welcome emails
3. Update the EmailJS configuration in the environment variables

### 3. Backend Setup

#### Navigate to Backend Directory
```bash
cd backend
```

#### Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Required Python Packages
The backend requires the following packages:
- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn`
- `firebase-admin`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `python-multipart`
- `python-dotenv`

#### Firebase Service Account
1. Copy your `serviceAccountKey.json` from the main directory to the `backend/` directory
2. Ensure the service account has read access to your Firestore collections

#### Start the Backend Server
```bash
# Option 1: Using the provided script
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh

# Option 2: Manual start
uvicorn recommendation_backend:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### 4. Data Generation (Optional)

To populate your database with sample data:

```bash
cd scripts
npm install
node generateAndUploadData.js
```

This will generate realistic mock data for:
- Students
- Faculty
- Mentors
- Startups
- Projects
- Hackathons

### 5. Start the Frontend

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
